# Dora Fork of /topic0 

## Important files

The file `DORA_CHAIN_LIST` contains a list of dora-supported chainIDs, which are then used to build the signature database. This should be updated if one wants to rebuild with a different set of supported chains.

## Extra Requirements

This fork makes use of the `fd` command as a faster alternative to `find`. 

On macOS, this can be installed via Homebrew with `brew install fd`
